# To do:
- Profile model for user profile to show list of attended events (or could be done in User#show)
- Past and Upcoming event base on date (by creating a datetime column in Event model)
- Separate the past and upcoming events on the Eventâ€™s Index page by creating two class methods on the Event model (e.g. Event.past).
- Use scopes for those two Event methods
- Make the page look good with CSS and JS
